Project Title: Flask DevOps App ‚Äì Automated CI/CD Deployment using Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS EC2

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps automation pipeline for deploying a Python Flask web application using Docker containers, GitHub Actions, and AWS EC2.
The objective is to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) that automatically builds, tests, and deploys an application every time changes are pushed to GitHub.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Tool: Purpose
- Python 3.11 + Flask	Web Application Framework
- Docker Containerization
- DockerHub	Image Registry
- GitHub Actions	CI/CD Automation
- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)	Deployment Server
- Gunicorn (optional)	Production WSGI Server


## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Containerize an application with Docker
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Deploy to AWS EC2
- Implement basic DevOps best practices
- Troubleshoot real-world deployment issues

## üß± Architecture:

Developer ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí Docker Build ‚Üí DockerHub ‚Üí AWS EC2 ‚Üí Running Flask App:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub (main branch)

2. GitHub Actions triggers automatically

3. The workflow:

    - Builds a Docker image from the app

    - Pushes it to DockerHub

    - Connects to EC2 via SSH

    - Pulls and runs the latest image

4. EC2 hosts the running containerized app, accessible via its public IP on port 5000.
